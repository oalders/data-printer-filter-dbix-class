NAME
    Data::Printer::Filter::DBIx::Class - Apply special Data::Printer filters
    to DBIx::Class objects

VERSION
    version 0.000001

SYNOPSIS
    In your program:

        use Data::Printer filters => { -external => ['DB'] };

    or, in your ".dataprinter" file:

        { filters => { -external => ['DB'] } };

DESCRIPTION
    Huge chunks of this have been lifted directly from
    Data::Printer::Filter::DB This filter differs in that it also adds the
    values from "get_columns()" to the output. For a DBIx::Class::Row
    object, the column values are return in the data. For a
    DBIx::Class::ResultSet, all of the rows in the resultset are returned,
    with the contents of "get_columns()" included. If you're dealing with
    huge resultsets, this may not be what you want. Caveat emptor.
