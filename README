NAME
    Data::Printer::Filter::DBIx::Class - Apply special Data::Printer filters
    to DBIx::Class objects

VERSION
    version 0.000004

SYNOPSIS
    In your program:

        use Data::Printer filters => { -external => ['DBIx::Class'] };

    or, in your ".dataprinter" file:

        { filters => { -external => ['DBIx::Class'] } };

DESCRIPTION
    Huge chunks of this have been lifted directly from
    Data::Printer::Filter::DB This filter differs in that it also adds the
    values from "get_columns()" to the output. For a DBIx::Class::Row
    object, the column values are return in the data. For a
    DBIx::Class::ResultSet, by default the first 5 rows in the ResultSet are
    returned, with the contents of "get_columns()" included. You can change
    this behaviour via $ENV{DDP_DBIC_ROW_LIMIT}.

        # Return up to 1,000 rows per ResultSet
        $ENV{DDP_DBIC_ROW_LIMIT} = 1000;

        # Return every row from every ResultSet
        $ENV{DDP_DBIC_ROW_LIMIT} = 0;
